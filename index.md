You can also discuss QuestKit at [the forum](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=15).

QuestKit is completely open source, including this documentation! The source code and documentation both live [on GitHub](https://github.com/textadventures/questkit) (documentation is in the `gh-pages` branch).
